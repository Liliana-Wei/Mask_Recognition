# Mask_Recognition
This project contains a comprehensive study on developing a mask recognition model using deep learning techniques. Our dataset comprises 440 images, equally divided between individuals wearing masks and those not wearing masks.

### Key Steps
<b> Data Preparation </b>  
I utilize data augmentation to enhance the training set due to the limited dataset size.  
<b> Model Development </b>  
A Deep Neural Network (DNN) serves as our base model, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) also explored for performance comparison.  
<b> Pre-trained Models </b>  
I investigate the use of pre-trained models and choose Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN) to boost accuracy and reduce training time.  
<b> Results and Analysis </b>  
Detailed methodology, results, discussions, and team contributions are presented.  
Our ultimate goal is to create a reliable mask recognition system to support safety measures in public spaces.
