# Mask_Recognition
This project contains a comprehensive study on developing a mask recognition model using deep learning techniques. Our dataset comprises 440 images, equally divided between individuals wearing masks and those not wearing masks.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: We utilize data augmentation to enhance the training set due to the limited dataset size.
Model Development: A Deep Neural Network (DNN) serves as our base model, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) also explored for performance comparison.
Pre-trained Models: We investigate the use of pre-trained models to boost accuracy and reduce training time.
Results and Analysis: Detailed methodology, results, discussions, and team contributions are presented.
Our ultimate goal is to create a reliable mask recognition system to support safety measures in public spaces.
